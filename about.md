Welcome to my academic and professional website. I am Lucas Vituri Santarosa, a Professor and Researcher at the School of Agronomy, Pontifical Catholic University of Valpara√≠so (PUCV).

My work is centered on the application of geospatial data science, remote sensing, and hydrological modeling to address critical challenges in water resources management. I leverage tools like Google Earth Engine and open-source software to analyze environmental data and develop solutions for a more sustainable future.

Here you will find my latest **[publications](/publications/)**, an overview of my **[research projects](/portfolio/)**, and information on my **[teaching activities](/teaching/)**. Please feel free to explore and get in touch for potential collaborations.
